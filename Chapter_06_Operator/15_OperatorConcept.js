//reassignment is allowed in case of var 
//what is the issue with var?
//var is function scoped, which means it can be accessed outside of the block it was defined in,
//leading to potential bugs and unexpected behavior. It can also be redeclared within the same scope, 
//which can cause confusion and errors in larger codebases.

let l = 20;
//let is a modern way of creating the variable in javascript
//let is block-scoped(lives only inside {}),can be reassigned, but can not be redeclared in the same scope
//It is hoisted but not initialized, so accessing it before declaring throws a Referrence Error
